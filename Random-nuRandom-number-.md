How does the system obtain the winning numbers?
The system calls the drawing method (draw) of the on-chain contract (lucky.daobox). When the drawing method is executed, it will obtain the block prefix (block prefix) of the current block and the block number of the block contained in the current transaction (transaction) ( block number), get the Trxid of the current transaction, and get the time of the current transaction as parameters to perform random calculations to obtain the winning number, and save the number to the corresponding cycle of the contract table (lucky.daobox), and finally rewards for this period are sent to the account holding this number.
