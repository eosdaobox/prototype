## DAOBOX Prototype Design
![daobox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125966495/224637502-d41e2f4b-f207-4d82-a3b5-c0b9ee01da6e.png)
- DAOBOX will create a powerful open source governance framework and provide a complete set of decentralized governance tools for the EOS ecosystem.
- Governance System: A system for managing proposals and consensus voting. In the crypto space, building a successful project requires a whole new set of specialized skills. Token economics, fund management, community governance, smart contract development, protocol security, etc. are very difficult for a new project. Due to the lack of governance tools, it is difficult for ordinary users to participate in the actual project construction. With With DAOBOX, this process will become simple and fast. DAOBOX gathers the best talents with professional skills from all over the world. They can participate in various communities and provide infinite possibilities for projects. As communities grow with hundreds of members, they often need a way to make collective decisions. Using the Governance System, the community can easily and quickly understand the wishes of the community and reach a consensus. It will be interesting to see who has completed the vote and how much voting power they have.
- Stake System: A proof-of-stake system for community governance. For a community project, community co-governance is an essential process. In order to complete this process, each project will create a pledge system to prove governance rights and interests, which requires a lot of development and management costs for brand new projects. This waste of time and money is meaningless. DAOBOX will develop a common framework to meet the pledge needs of different communities. At the same time, this part will also undergo multiple audits to ensure the safety of community assets.
- Reward System: A reward system for community governance. In the governance process of DAO, it is indispensable to reward members who participate in community governance. This measure will actively promote members' community contributions, and at the same time attract more members with professional skills to join the community and promote the development of the community's goals.
- The DAOBOX prototype will be open source so that other teams can use DAOBOX as a good reference when building governance tools, and it can also be built in the framework of DAOBOX to improve the system or increase the diversity of tools. The organizational structure of DAOs looks like a modern cooperative model, but in the next decade, it is believed that their size and influence will rival some of the largest public companies in the world.

## DAOBOX 产品原型
- DAOBOX 将创建一个强大的开源治理框架，为 EOS 生态系统提供一整完整的去中心化治理工具。
- 治理系统：用于管理提案与共识投票的系统。在加密领域，构建一个成功的项目需要一套全新的专业技能。代币经济学、资金管理、社区治理、智能合约开发、协议安全等，这对一个全新项目来说是非常困难的，由于缺乏治理工具，普通用户很难参与到实际的项目建设中，有了 DAOBOX，这个过程将就变得简单且快捷。DAOBOX中聚集了全世界具有专业技能的最优秀人才，他们可以参与到各个社区，为项目提供无限的可能。拥有数百名成员的社区在发展过程中，通常需要一种方法来做出集体决策。使用Governance System，社区可以方便快捷的了解社区意愿并达成共识。你可以看到谁完成了投票，他们有多少投票权，这将很有趣。
- 质押系统：用于社区治理的权益证明系统。对于一个社区项目，社区共同治理是必不可少的过程，为了完成这一过程，每一个项目都会创建质押系统用来证明治理权益，这对于全新的项目来说需要大量的开发成本与管理成本，这种时间与金钱的消耗是无意义的。DAOBOX将为此开发一套公用的框架，满足不同社区对质押的需求，同时，该部分也将经过多家审计，保证社区资产的安全。
- 奖励系统：用于社区治理的奖励系统。在DAO的治理过程中，不可缺少的是对参与社区治理成员的奖励，该措施将积极推动成员的社区贡献，同时将吸引到更多拥有专业技能的成员加入社区，推动社区的目标向前发展。
- DAOBOX原型将完全公开，以便其他团队在构建治理工具时可以使用 DAOBOX 作为很好的参考，同样的也可以构建在DAOBOX的框架中，以完善系统或是提高工具的多样性。DAO 的组织结构看起来像现代合作模式，但在未来十年，相信它们的规模和影响力将与世界上一些最大的上市公司相媲美。
